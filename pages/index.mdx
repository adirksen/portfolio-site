Hey, I have been a web developer going on 11 years now and actively work as a freelance developer.

I specialize in providing comprehensive web/native mobile application development services for small business and early-stage startups.

My expertise lies in creating visually appealing, highly-engaging applications and websites that meet the specific needs of clients and their users.

I am well-versed in various web technologies and have a track record of delivering effective solutions that drive growth for my clients.

I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at [Protego Trust Bank](https://www.protegotrust.com/) where I craft institutional-grade banking and custodial interfaces that are beautiful and functional with Next.js, React and Typescript.

I also really like working with golang, rust, scala and python. ðŸ¤–
